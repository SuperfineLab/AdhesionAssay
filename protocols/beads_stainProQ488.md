# Staining Mucus-coated Beads with Pro-Q 488[^1] Glycoprotein Dye

## Motivation

This protocol uses a green-channel staining kit that is itself based largely on the standard Fluorescent Schiff-like reagent protocol already used in the project. This Pro-Q 488 fluorophore is selected due to its >50x more signal-to-noise staining power for the same glycans (over Fluorescent PAS Schiff-like reagent). This specific version of the protocol works on staining HBE mucus previously coupled to beads using [our coupling protocol](./beads_surfacemodify.md).

## Materials and Reagents needed

- **Fix Solution**: 50% methanol, 5% glacial acetic acid, dilute to volume with deionized water.
- **Wash Solution**: 3% glacial acetic acid diluted by deionized water.
- **Oxidizing solution**: Periodic acid (Component B) diluted to volume in 3% acetic acid.
- **Staining solution**: 1:10 dilution of ProQ 488 stain in DMSO. Filter on amicon filter with 20 kDa centrifugation filter to reduce amount of crystallized fluorophore.

## Steps for Staining Beads

1. Run [bead coupling protocol](./beads_surfacemodify.md) with HBE as the surface functionalization, BUT use non-fluorescent beads (e.g., Spherotech, CM-200-10 -- 20 Âµm diameter) or else the ProQ stain will be unimagable. Store under PBS until ready for use.

2. Run [centrifugation wash](#centwash) 3 times (3x) with DI water.

3. Use [centrifugation wash](#centwash) _twice_ with **Fixing Solution** to replace DI water. Incubate at room temperature and mix end-over-end for 1 hour.

4. Use [centrifugation wash](#centwash) 3x with **wash solution**.

5. Use centrifuation wash with **Oxidizing solution** _twice_. Incubate at room tempature and mix end-over-end for 20 minutes.

6. Use [centrifugation wash](#centwash) with **wash solution**. Incubate with wash solution for 10 minutes while mixing end-over-end. REPEAT THIS FOR A TOTAL OF THREE WASHES.

7. Use [centrifugation wash](#centwash) 2x with **staining solution**. Incubate at room temperature while mixing end-over-end for one hour.

   > **Important**: From this point on, keep the sample tube in a dark environment, e.g., covered with aluminum foil, to avoid photobleaching the fluorophore.

8. [Centrifuge wash](#centwash) 3x into deionized water and end-over-end mix for 10 minutes between each wash. Remember to keep the beads in a dark environment when incubating.

9. [Centrifuge wash](#centwash) 2x - 3x into methanol.

    > It's important to remove enough water that the beads will dry separated while on the test slide.

10. The last time you resuspend the beads in methanol, use about 1:10 the final resuspension volume.

11. Vortex the beads for a short duration (less than 2 seconds) and withdraw as much volume as desired with a pipet. Deliver the volume onto a clean, dry microscope slide. Use the edge/side of the pipet tip to spread the solution out along the surface area of the slide.

    > This distributes the beads across the slide in a solvent with a high vapor pressure. As the methanol dries quickly, the beads won't get carried along the solvent front.

12. Once the sample is dry (it should only take ~10min), the sample can be imaged under FITC fluorescence conditions.

## <a id="centwash"> Support protocol: Centrifugation wash</a>

1. Spin bead suspension at 6000 RPM for 15 seconds in minicentrifuge.
2. Aspirate supernatant with pipet. Save pellet.
3. Add new suspension medium/solution (DI water, PBS, methanol, etc)
4. Resuspend pellet. Use very short bursts of vortexing and/or sonication if necessary to resuspend pellet (no longer than 1 or 2 seconds per burst).
5. Mix end-over-end at room temp for alloted time.
