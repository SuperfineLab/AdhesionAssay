# Staining Mucus-coated Slide/substrate with Pro-Q 488[^1]

## Motivation

This protocol uses a green-channel staining kit that is itself based largely on the standard Fluorescent Schiff-like reagent protocol already used in the project. This Pro-Q 488 fluorophore is selected due to its >50x more signal-to-noise staining power for the same glycans. This specific version of the protocol works on staining HBE mucus previous coupled to the glass substrate using our coupling protocol.

## Materials and Reagents needed

- **Fix Solution**: 50% methanol, 5% glacial acetic acid, dilute to volume with deionized water.
- **Wash Solution**: 3% glacial acetic acid diluted by deionized water.
- **Oxidizing solution**: Periodic acid (Component B) diluted to volume in 3% acetic acid.
- **Staining solution**: 1:10 dilution of ProQ 488 stain in DMSO. Filter on amicon filter with 20 kDa centrifugation filter to reduce amount of crystallized fluorophore.

## Steps

1. Run slide coupling protocol with HBE as the surface functionalization. Store under PBS until ready for use.

   > Take care not to overtly scratch the well surface with the pipette or aspiration tip while working.

2. Wash the prepared slide 3 times (3x) with DI water (60 µL per well per wash).

3. Replace DI water with **Fixing Solution** _twice_ (to avoid dilution by previous volume of DI water). Incubate at room temperature on an orbital shaker set at 60 RPM for 1 hour. Cover with box to keep sample slide in darkness.

4. Wash 3x with **wash solution**.

5. Replace DI water with **Oxidizing solution** _twice_. Incubate at room tempature for 20 minutes on orbital mixer set at 60 RPM.

6. Wash wells with **wash solution**. Incubate with wash solution for 10 minutes on orbital shaker. REPEAT THIS FOR A TOTAL OF THREE WASHES.

7. Add 60 µL of **staining solution** to each well. Incubate at room temperature on orbital shaker for one hour.

   > Important: From this point on, keep the sample slide in a dark environment (e.g., small opaque box) to avoid photobleaching the fluorophore.

8. Wash 3x into deionized water. Remember to keep the slide in a dark environment when incubating. Put on orbital shaker for 10 minutes between each wash.

9. Wash 2x - 3x into methanol.

10. Aspirate the final volume of methanol and allow the slide to air dry.

11. Once the sample is dry (it should only take ~10min), the sample can be imaged under FITC fluorescence conditions.
