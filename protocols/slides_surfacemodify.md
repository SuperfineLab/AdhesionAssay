# Coupling Ligand-amines to TEPSA slides

## Activation

1. Prep 50 mm x 75 mm x 1 mm slide with COOH-silane (TEPSA) and hydrolyze. Clean slide with IPA and dry with slow nitrogen gas (i.e., not air gun velocity). Add 15-well adhesive cutout and carefully eliminate any bubbles underneath the slide without damaging the glass surface in the wells. Put slide into the lid of a 50 mm petri-dish. Glue to dish surface by "spot-welding" with Norland and treating with UV light for 5 minutes. Keep old petri-dish base to serve as the new "lid."

2. Prep 1 mL of NHS/EDAC solution by first adding 1 mL of 50 mM MES and ~10 mg of NHS (Up to 25 mg is also fine) to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Vortex to dissolve.

3. Prep workplace with a 200 µL pipettor and appropriate tips as well as any buffers or other reagents needed for the reaction.

4. Right before beginning slide activation, pipette two 60 µL volumes of NHS solution into 10+ mg EDAC previously weighed out into a 200 µL tube and pump the liquid up and down to dissolve. Remove ALL liquid by pipetting it (in two or more deliveries) back into the NHS solution.

5. Vortex the NHS-EDAC solution and IMMEDIATELY pipette 60 µL of NHS/EDAC solution into each well of the plate.

6. Cover/close plate and put into 37 °C incubator for 1 hour (30 min is probably fine).


## Coupling (see "Coupling solution preps" section below for specific coupling protocols)

1. After one hour of activation, remove slide from 37 °C incubator.

2. To remove unreacted NHS and EDAC, aspirate NHS/EDC solution using 1 mL pipette tip attached to vacuum pump and aspiration flask. Immediately replace with 60 µL of 50 mM MES in each well. Repeat for a total of two washes.

3. To begin coupling reaction with amine-ligand, pipette 60 µL of PBS-buffered coupling solution (containing protein or whatever amine-ligand) into each well.

4. Cover/close plate and put into 37 °C incubator for 2 hours.


## Capping with glycine or TRIS (if using)

1. After two hours of coupling, remove unreacted amine-ligand by aspirating coupling solution using 1 mL pipette tip attached to vacuum pump and aspiration flask.  

2. Immediately replace with 60 µL of 100 mM TRIS-base titrated to a pH of 7.4. This buffer contains a primary amine that caps off any unreacted NHS and doesn't replace them with another COOH. Alternatively, use 1 mg/mL glycine instead of TRIS.

3. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.


## Washing

1. After 30 min capping (if used), remove slide from 37 °C incubator.

2. Aspirate the coupling or capping solution.

3. If washing with surfactant, immediately replace with 60 µL of 0.5% TWEEN20 in PBS and let rest for 5-10 min at room temp (or 37 °C). (Future direction: consider using orbital shaker). Repeat 2 more times for a total of 3 surfactant-washes.

4. Repeat washes with plain PBS an addition 3 more times with no rest period for a grand total 6 washes.  

5. When finished, ensure there is 60 µL of PBS left on each well surface. Well surface MUST remain wetted.


## Coupling solution preps

1. NH2-PEG2k-COOH (Linker-PEG, L-PEG): 1 mg/mL L-PEG in PBS is in the freezer in B34A pump room. Thaw completely and rotate end-over-end for 5 minutes before use. Dilute to desire concentration (or leave as-is) and use as a coupling reagent. Repeat activation and coupling steps to bind ligand to terminal carboxy on the NH2-PEG2k-COOH.

2. NH2-PEG2k-FITC (fluorescent-PEG, f-PEG): 1 mg/mL f-PEG in PBS is stored in 1.5 mL amber-color Eppendorf tubes in the freezer in the B34A pump room. Thaw completely and rotate end-over-end for 5 minutes before use. Dilute to desire concentration (or leave as-is) and use as a coupling reagent.

3. 100 nm NH2 beads (amine-beads):  Use a 1:1000 dilution of beads in PBS and 0.5% Tween20 as the coupling solution. Sonicate for 10 minutes before coupling step.

4. HBE mucus: Thaw 100 µL of HBE mucus from the freezer and add 900 µL of PBS. Rotate at room temp for ~ 30 min before coupling to glass substrate. Neither capping with glycine or TRIS nor washing with surfactant are necessary (or at least done historically) at this time.
