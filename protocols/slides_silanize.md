# Silanizing slides for the Adhesion Assay

## Plasma clean slides

1. [Follow general lab protocol](https://github.com/SuperfineLab/SLaP/blob/main/equipment/plasma_cleaning_glass.md) with the following settings:
   pump down time: 30 seconds
   plasma treatment duration: 15 minutes

   Note: Only treat (plasma clean) one 50 x 75 mm slide at one time.


## Vapor deposition of TEPSA (silane) onto the glass slide 

1. IMMEDIATELY after plasma cleaning, add 1% TEPSA in toluene (Down to 10^-5 concentration likely works just as well). 

2. Add 40 uL of 1% TEPSA into each aluminum boat in large (120 mm dia?) petri dish. 

3. Incubate in dry oven at 70ยบ C overnight.
