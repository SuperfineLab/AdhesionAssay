# Surface-coating 24 µm Beads for the Adhesion Assay

## Protocol Steps

1. Dilute 100 µL of stock 24 um bead solution (1% w/v) to 1 mL reaction volume in 50 mM MES, pH=6.1.

2. Wash beads into 50 mM MES buffer, pH=6.1, by centrifuging 3 min at 3000 rpm, which causes the beads to form a pellet. Keep the pellet. Extract and discard supernatant without disturbing pellet.

3. Repeat wash twice more, for a total of three washes, reconstituting each time into 50 mM MES.

4. Add 10 mg of NHS (or one pre-prepared "tube" for reactions such as this). Vortex. Add 10 mg EDC (Or, like the NHS, pre-prepared tube). Vortex. Rotate end-over-end for 1 hour at room temp.

5. Spin out beads (3 min at 3000 RPM) ONCE. Extract supernatant. Keep pellet. Resuspend in 100 µL of PBS buffer. Vortex to distribute pellet. See notes.

6. Add 900 µL of 1 mg/mL ligand (e.g., methoxy-PEG2k-amine) solution. Vortex to quickly distribute beads and then rotate end-over-end at room temp for 2 hours. See notes for other ligands.

7. Continue rotation overnight at 4° C. This step can likely be skipped.

8. If not waiting for coupling to finish overnight, then use glycine quenching. Add 10-15 mg glycine to cap-off any unreacted activated carboxyl groups. Rotate end-over-end for 30 minutes at room temperature. This is likely unnecessary given the amount of PEG excess, but glycine is a much smaller molecule and can get into nooks and crannies of the bead surface that the PEG likely cannot because of stearic interference.

9. Wash beads three times into PBS using same protocol as in step 2.

10. On last wash, resuspend to 100 µL to return to original bead number concentration.

## Notes

- EDC is notoriously unstable and should be kept dry. When I was in industry we opened a new bottle every time we did an EDC ligation. Here, we open the bottle, dispense aliquots of 10 mg into individual Eppendorf tubes under dry conditions and keep the aliquots under nitrogen at 4 ºC and the source bottle in the freezer in a desiccator.
- Sometimes I will add an extra wash if the excess mass of NHS and EDC is a "large" excess, i.e., if the diluted concentration of any remanining NHS and EDC would significantly affect further linking between beads or proteins.
- Other ligands include: 1 mg/mL lectins, such as PNA, PWM, WGA, or SNA; 1 mg/mL HBE mucus; 1 mg/mL NH2-PEG2k-NH2; 1 mg/mL methoxy-PEG2k-amine; and, any florescent versions of those already mentioned.
- Prepared solutions of ligands at the appropriate concentrations for this protocol can often be found in the pump room freezer in appropriately-labeled boxes.
- The [Spherotech Technical Note](./support/spherotech_STN-1_rev_C.pdf) for coating particles recommends "use 0.5 mg of Avidin per 2 mL of 2.5% w/v magnetic particles and 5 mg of EDC" for 4.25 um diameter magnetic beads. According to calculations, this is only 3x to 8x fold excess ligand reagent than what is theoretically needed for full bead coverage. For our 1% w/v 24 um magnetic beads, this level of excess corresponds to a final ligand solution of ~12.5 ug/mL.
- We've routinely used 0.1 mg/mL as the final ligand binding solution, added at 1 mg/mL to 10-fold dilution in NHS-EDC activated beads.
