# Staining Mucus with Fluorescent PAS [^1]


## Materials and Reagents needed

1% Periodic Acid (i.e. 0.5g Periodic Acid, 1.5mL Acetic Acid, 50mL dH2O) 

Fluorescent Schiff-like reagent (i.e. 0.25g Acid Fuschin, 0.5g Sodium Metabisulfite, 0.5mL 1M HCl, 50mL H2O) 


## Steps

1. Pipet 20µL of mucus sample onto a slide and dry the slide overnight at room temp. (note that it is possible to dry the mucus at 4° or at 37°, but it is not advised to go higher than 37° as the higher temp. may interfere with mucin integrity) 

2. On the prepared slide, add 20µL of 1% Periodic Acid. 

3. After 10 mins, pipet off the periodic acid, taking care not to touch/tear the dried layer of mucus. 

4. Then add 20 µL of Fluorescent Schiff-like reagent. 

5. After 20 mins, pipet off the excess taking care not to touch/tear the dried layer of mucus. 

6. Rinse and pipet off the sample with 20 µL of dH2O taking care not to touch/tear the dried layer of mucus. When pipetting off the dH2O, gently pipet-mix the acid wash a few times, this helps remove excess fluorescent Schiff-like reagent which helps reduce the background signal. 

7. Repeat step 6 1-3 more times. 

8. Once the sample is dry (it should only take ~10min), the sample can be imaged under fluorescence.
